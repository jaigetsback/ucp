Analysis of Factors Influencing Used Car Prices
-----------------------------------------------

Objective: The primary goal of our data analysis was to identify the key factors influencing used car prices. By understanding what makes a car more or less expensive, we aimed to provide clear recommendations to our client for fine-tuning their inventory.

Best Model Selection:
---------------------
The Random Forest Regression model with hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV emerged as the best choice among the six models tested.
The selected hyperparameters (e.g., max_depth, min_samples_split, and n_estimators) contribute to achieving the lowest error estimators (mean squared error, mean absolute error, and R2 score).
Notably, the selected hyperparameters were:
max_depth: None
min_samples_split: 2
n_estimators: 200
An R2 score of 0.82 indicates that your model captures around 82% of the variance in used car prices, which is quite promising.
The prediction estimates provide a nice correlation between the actual and predicted values and the Error has a normal distribution, centered around the mean

Feature Importance:
--------------------
The key features that significantly influence used car prices, according to the Random Forest model, include:
“fuel,” “manufacturer,” “type,” “cylinders,” “drive,” “year,” and “odometer.”
These features align with what customers value when purchasing a used car, and the permutation importance confirms their impact.

Other Observations:
-------------------
Odometer reading and year of manufacture strongly correlate with price, as expected.
Specific attributes, such as trucks (e.g., RAM), high-cylinder engines, diesel vehicles, and electric cars, impact price margins.

Data Cleanup and Challenges:
----------------------------
Handling null values and ensuring a cleaner dataset are essential steps. While some nulls were dropped, further improvements could enhance prediction accuracy.
Mismatched fields (e.g., inconsistent values) may stem from input data quality. Ideally, starting with clean data would yield better results.


Deployment Strategy
--------------------
Abstract: Our analysis aims to provide valuable insights for used car dealers seeking to fine-tune their inventory. By understanding customer preferences and the factors influencing used car prices, we can optimize stock selection and pricing strategies.

Key Findings
-------------

1. Best Model Selection
-----------------------
After evaluating six models, the Random Forest Regression model with hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV emerged as the top performer.
Selected hyperparameters:
max_depth: None
min_samples_split: 2
n_estimators: 200
An impressive R2 score of 0.82 indicates that our model captures approximately 82% of the variance in used car prices.

2. Feature Importance
----------------------
The following features significantly influence used car prices:
Fuel type: Customers show preferences for specific fuel types (e.g., gas, diesel, electric).
Manufacturer: Brand reputation impacts pricing.
Car type: Sedans, SUVs, and trucks have varying price ranges.
Number of cylinders: High-cylinder engines affect prices.
Drive type: All-wheel drive (AWD) or front-wheel drive (FWD) matters.
Year of manufacture: Newer cars tend to command higher prices.
Odometer reading: Mileage directly impacts value.

3. Other Observations
----------------------
Odometer and Year: As expected, odometer reading and year of manufacture strongly correlate with price. Low mileage and recent models are desirable.
Specific Attributes: Certain attributes affect price margins:
Trucks (e.g., RAM) tend to be pricier.
High-cylinder engines may increase costs.
Diesel vehicles and electric cars have distinct pricing patterns.

4. Recommendations
-------------------
Inventory Selection:
Stock popular brands and models based on customer preferences.
Prioritize low-mileage, newer vehicles.
Consider offering a mix of fuel types to cater to diverse buyers.

Pricing Strategies:
Adjust prices based on features (e.g., AWD, cylinders).
Highlight unique attributes (e.g., electric drivetrain) to justify higher prices.

Data Quality:
Continuously clean and update your dataset to improve prediction accuracy.
Address null values and inconsistencies.
Understanding customer preferences and aligning inventory with market demand will enhance customer success
